# Optimising-the-set-of-POVM-s-to-Achieve-HOLEVO-Bound
Maximising the Mutual Information between Bob’s Measurement And Alice’s Transmission by
optimising the set of POVM’s to achieve HOLEVO Bound.Achieved a max mutual Info of 0.815
by optimizing set of 3 POVM’s for exercise problem for given Alice’s Quantum States given in
Nelson and Chuang in which the Holevo Bound was 1.0 .Machine Learning Models can be
developed to further optimize and generalize the POVM’s to achieve Holevo Bound (Scope of
Future Work).
